# Print Stack

## deployed link

[Working application](https://stackprint.vercel.app/)


## About
Stackprint helps you find the stack you didn't know you needed. It uses Metaphor to organize the web and return helpful information.

## Purpose
As developers, we often get stuck using the same tools over and over again. While repition is great for building products that serve stakeholders well, sometimes we just want to build something new.
The purpose of Stackprint is to organize the web using AI and return inspiration for your new passion project.

## Tools
- Metaphor
- Nextjs
- Tailwind
- Axois

## ICEBOX (future improvements):
Metaphor allows you to grab the content of a returned search result. I'm currently doing research into AI assistents that can be intergrated into this StackPrint and seamlessly parse through the content. In doing so the AI can use a dynamic prompt like "Give this {content} provide me with the code / steps to create{application_description}". 

Currently, javascript is use for this front facing app. All abstractions will be moved to a server coded in python. This will allow for easier integration with other AI assistants or LLM's.
